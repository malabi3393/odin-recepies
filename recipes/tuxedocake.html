    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>So when I did my research on tuxedo cakes, there was no one right answer on what exactly a tuxedo cake is and where it originated. The consensus is that it’s basically a cake that’s black and white. </p>
    <p>To keep it a true black and white, most people incorporate some form of dark chocolate and some form of white chocolate in the recipe. It should also visually be black and white. </p>
